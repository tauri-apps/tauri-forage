interface, which, while\n *  still available, has been split out into three distinct calls.\n *  Also, are using `.then` instead of the callback approach, and\n *  always catch an error.\n *\n *  Of note are the extensions to the generic interface:\n *  - mergeItem (with a number of merge strategies available)\n *  - getKeyValue\n *  - deleteItemKey\n *  - hasKey\n *  - hasKeyValue\n *\n *  Note:\n *  Even if undefined is saved, null will be returned by getItem().\n *  This is due to a limitation in localStorage, and for compatibility\n *  reasons localForage cannot store the value undefined.\n *\n *  The process is:\n *  1. forage.config({object})\n *  2. forage.ready()\n *  3. forage.set('user', { age: 12 })\n *  4. forage.get('user')\n *  5. forage.clear()\n *\n * Usage Options:\n * 1. Exactly the same interface as localForage\n * 2. With a currying function applied to the result\n * 3. Modify the value returned (with or without curry)\n * 4. Define error suppression\n *\n * @category forage\n * @namespace forage\n */\nconst forage = {\n  /**\n   * @description get the object of a specific row if it exists.\n   * @\n   * @param {string} key\n   * @param {string} logger\n   * @param {number} returner\n   * @returns {Promise<object|string|*>}\n   * @function getItem\n   * @memberof forage\n   */\n  getItem ({ key, logger, returner, before, store }: BeforeItem = {}) {\n    return async function (curry?: MaybeFunction) {\n      const storage = await _defineStore({ store: store })\n      key = before ? await handler.maybeCurry(curry || null)(key) : key\n      return handler.returner(\n        storage.getItem(key).then(async (v: any) => {\n          return !before ? handler.maybeCurry(curry || null)(v) : v\n        }).catch((err: any) => {\n          /* istanbul ignore next */\n          return handler.logger(err, logger)\n        })\n      )(returner)\n    }\n  },\n  /**\n   * @description get the value of a specific key in a row if it exists.\n   *\n   * @param {string} key\n   * @param {string} value\n   * @param {function} curry\n   * @param {string} logger\n   * @param {number|string} returner\n   * @returns {Promise<object|string|*>}\n   * @function getKeyValue\n   * @memberof forage\n   */\n  getKeyValue ({ key, value, logger, returner, before, store }: KeyValueItem = {}) {\n    return async function (curry?: MaybeFunction) {\n      const storage = await _defineStore({ store: store })\n      value = before ? await handler.maybeCurry(curry || null)(value) : value\n      return handler.returner(\n        storage.getItem(key).then((v: any) => {\n          // console.log(v)\n          return !before ? handler.maybeCurry(curry || null)(v[value]) : v[value]\n        }).catch((err: any) => {\n          /* istanbul ignore next */\n          return handler.logger(err, logger)\n        })\n      )(returner)\n    }\n  },\n  /**\n   * @description set an row if it exists, completely overwrite it if\n   * it does not exist.\n   *\n   * @param {string} key\n   * @param {string} value\n   * @param {...Function|string|number} restArgs\n   * @param {function} restArgs.curry\n   * @param {string} restArgs.logger\n   * @param {number} restArgs.returner\n   * @returns {Promise<object|string|*>}\n   * @function setItem\n   * @memberof forage\n   */\n  setItem ({ key, value, logger, returner, before, store }: KeyValueItem = {}) {\n    return async function (curry?: MaybeFunction) {\n      const storage = _defineStore({ store: store })\n      value = before ? await handler.maybeCurry(curry || null)(value) : value\n      return handler.returner(\n        storage.setItem(key, value).then(async (v: any) => {\n          return !before ? handler.maybeCurry(curry || null)(v) : v\n        }).catch((err: any) => {\n          /* istanbul ignore next */\n          return handler.logger(err, logger)\n        })\n      )(returner)\n    }\n  },\n  /**\n   *\n   * @param {...Function|string|number} restArgs\n   * @param {number} restArgs.index\n   * @param {function} restArgs.curry\n   * @param {string} restArgs.logger\n   * @param {number} restArgs.returner\n   * @returns {Promise<string>}\n   * @function setItem\n   * @memberof forage\n   */\n  key ({ index, logger, returner, before, store }: IndexItem = {}) {\n    return async function (curry: MaybeFunction) {\n      const storage = await _defineStore({ store: store })\n      index = before ? await handler.maybeCurry(curry || null)(index) : index\n      return handler.returner(\n        storage.key(index).then((v: any) => {\n          return !before ? handler.maybeCurry(curry || null)(v) : v\n        }).catch((err: any) => {\n          /* istanbul ignore next */\n          return handler.logger(err, logger)\n        })\n      )(returner)\n    }\n  },\n  /**\n   * @description Merging data shouldn't be hard, so that logic is in here.\n   * There are so many ways to do it though, that the caller can define\n   * merge strategy.
